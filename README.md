## üöÄ Quick Start

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.7+
- Node.js 14+
- npm or yarn
- Microphone access for speech features

### Installation

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/shrutz2/DysLexiCheck.git
   cd DysLexiCheck
   ```

2. **Install Python dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Install frontend dependencies**
   ```bash
   cd frontend
   npm install
   cd ..
   ```

### Running the Application

#### Option 1: Streamlit App (Recommended)
```bash
python run_app.py
```
or
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

#### Option 2: Full Stack (Frontend + Backend)
```bash
# Terminal 1 - Backend
cd backend
python app.py

# Terminal 2 - Frontend
cd frontend
npm start
```

#### Option 3: Windows Batch File
```bash
start_app.bat
```

## üîß Configuration

### Azure Cognitive Services Setup
1. Create an Azure Cognitive Services account
2. Get your subscription key and endpoint
3. Update the credentials in `app.py`:
   ```python
   subscription_key_imagetotext = "YOUR_SUBSCRIPTION_KEY"
   endpoint_imagetotext = "YOUR_ENDPOINT"
   ```

### Bing Spell Check API
1. Get Bing Spell Check API key
2. Update in `app.py`:
   ```python
   api_key_textcorrection = "YOUR_API_KEY"
   ```

## üìä How It Works

### 1. Handwriting Analysis
- **Image to Text**: Uses Azure Computer Vision API to extract text from handwriting samples
- **Feature Extraction**: Calculates 4 key metrics:
  - Spelling accuracy
  - Grammatical accuracy  
  - Percentage of corrections needed
  - Phonetic accuracy using multiple algorithms (Soundex, Metaphone, Caverphone, NYSIIS)

## üê≥ Docker

This project includes simple Docker support. The backend image will build the React frontend and serve the static files via the Flask app.

Build and run with docker-compose (recommended):

```powershell
# From the project root
docker-compose build
docker-compose up
```

Direct build (backend context builds frontend automatically):

```powershell
docker build -t dyslexic-backend ./backend
docker run -p 5000:5000 dyslexic-backend
```

Notes:
- The container exposes port 5000. Point your browser to http://localhost:5000
- Secrets (Azure keys, Bing API key) are still stored in code for development. For production, set them with environment variables or Docker secrets and update the code to read from env vars.


### 2. Machine Learning Model
- **Algorithm**: Decision Tree Classifier
- **Training Data**: 100 handwriting samples (50 dyslexic, 50 non-dyslexic)
- **Features**: 4-dimensional feature vector from handwriting analysis
- **Accuracy**: Optimized for early dyslexia detection

### 3. Pronunciation Testing
- **Speech Recognition**: Real-time audio capture and processing
- **Phonetic Analysis**: Converts speech to IPA (International Phonetic Alphabet)
- **Comparison**: Measures pronunciation accuracy using Levenshtein distance

### 4. Dictation Assessment
- **Audio Playback**: Text-to-speech for word dictation
- **User Input**: Text input for heard words
- **Scoring**: Accuracy measurement based on correct word recognition

## üéØ Usage Guide

### Handwriting Test
1. Navigate to the "Writing" tab
2. Upload a JPG image of handwriting sample
3. Click "Predict" to get dyslexia probability assessment

### Pronunciation Test
1. Go to "Pronunciation" tab
2. Select appropriate grade level
3. Click "Start pronunciation test"
4. Repeat the displayed words within 10 seconds
5. View phonetic accuracy results

### Dictation Test
1. Open "Dictation" tab
2. Check "start dictation" 
3. Select grade level
4. Listen to 10 words and type them in the form
5. Submit to see accuracy score

## üìà Results and Analytics

The application provides detailed analytics including:
- **Spelling Accuracy Percentage**: Measures correct spelling vs errors
- **Grammatical Accuracy**: Grammar and syntax correctness
- **Correction Percentage**: Amount of corrections needed
- **Phonetic Accuracy**: Pronunciation correctness using multiple phonetic algorithms

## üî¨ Research Background

Based on research showing that dyslexic individuals typically demonstrate:
- Lower spelling accuracy (‚â§96.4% vs >96.4% for non-dyslexic)
- Higher correction requirements
- Phonetic processing difficulties
- Consistent patterns in handwriting characteristics
